Welcome to reWear!
The place where you can find and sell fashionable and timeless yet affordable clothing.

Our vision: 
Our motto at reWear is "Reduce, Reuse, and Reimagine," so we aim to change people's view on secondhand clothing. 
By purchasing and reselling unwanted items in their wardrobe,
reusing them to appreciate their value, and lastly, adding new, one-of-a kind pieces to their collection.

What we hope to achieve:
1. Curated items: At reWear, we make sure that all items are carefully chosen and in good condition to be sold.
2. Sustainability: As most materials used in clothing are genetically modified, it is better for the environment to buy secondhand clothing than brand new.
That way, we can help reduce waste and live out the life motto "reduce, reuse, recycle.".
3. Affordable prices: at reWear, we offer affordable items with great prices that compete with market prices.
4. User-Friendly shopping experience: browse through our website, find items you like, add them to your cart, and pay at checkout. It's that simple!
